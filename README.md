    # Simple-port-scanner
This is a simple port scanner. 

    ## REQUIREMENTS:
Python -To install Python, I recommend using Visual Studio Code and Searching for a Python installment. You do not need any more libraries.

    ##To run the script:
1.Open Visual Studio Code(This will be referred to as VSC) 
2.Click the elipsis at the top -select terminal 
3.In Github: select password-check, then click on code, and copy the HTTPS link 
4.In VSC terminal type git clone (then paste the https link) 
5.After cloning the repo, click file, then open folder, find the folder with password-check, select it 
6.Once you see all of the code click the play icon located at the top right of the viewing 
7.In the terminal, it will have Enter a host to scan (e.g., '127.0.0.1' or 'scanme.nmpa.org):

    ## Port scanner   
-To use the port scanner, after the colon symbol(in the terminal) 
   -enter the url or IP address you wish to scan, (for testing purposes I used scanme.nmap.org)
  -After the address, it will prompt you for the start port and end port
    -these can be any number you want, but I stuck with the port numbers for FTP and Kerberos(20 and 88)
-It will then tell you what Port is open 
  -"Port 22: OPEN"
  
    ## Future improvements
-Auto fill ports that are frequently checked, bypassing the prompt to enter a start and end port. This eliminates user input errors in the terminal.
